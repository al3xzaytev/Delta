TODO:

- ADD 2-PLAYER SUPPORT - done, but many things are now broken: need to fix adding new player when one dies
- FIX: Remove Poisoned effect after defeating the Mage
- CONFIGS

- Implement new print message system
- Add item system
    - Items can be picked up after defeating a monster
    - Items can be used to defeat one monster; they are lost after defeating a monster.
    - Different monsters drop different items:
        - Defeating the mage gives you the Mage Robe (poison resistance) or Poison Potion (added damage every turn)
        - Defeating the skeleton gives you the Revenant Touch (lifesteal on every attack) or Undying Locket (heal buff)
        - Defeating the knight gives you the Shield (chance to block attack) or Armor (lessen damage)
        - Defeating the orc gives you the Great-Sword (damage buff) or Orc Flesh (HP boost)
- Add more monster types (spiders)
- Implement more stats??? (agility - dodge attacks; speed - attacks per turn...)
